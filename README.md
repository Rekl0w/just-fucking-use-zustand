# JUST FUCKING USE ZUSTAND 🐻

A brutally honest, aggressively styled single-page website that tells you why you should stop overthinking and just use [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management.

## 🤬 What the fuck is this?

This is a parody/tribute site inspired by [justfuckingusehtml.com](https://justfuckingusehtml.com) and [justfuckingusereact.com](https://justfuckingusereact.com), but for Zustand - the tiny, fast, and scalable state management library that doesn't give a fuck about your Redux trauma.

## 🎨 Features

- **Single HTML file** - Because sometimes simplicity is actually fucking simple
- **No build process** - Just open it in a browser, you don't need webpack for everything
- **Syntax highlighting** - Using Prism.js because we're not animals
- **Responsive design** - Works on your phone, your tablet, and your grandma's ancient laptop
- **Aggressive tone** - Because sometimes developers need tough love
- **Bear emoji** - 🐻 Because Zustand's mascot is adorable and we need more bears in tech
- **Floating GitHub button** - So you can star the repo and feel good about yourself

## 🚀 What's Inside?

### Content Sections:
- **What the fuck is Zustand?** - A no-bullshit explanation
- **Why the fuck should you use it?** - Comparing it to Redux, Context API, and MobX
- **When should you use it?** - Spoiler: Always
- **How the fuck do you use it?** - Actual code examples that work
- **The real problem** - It's not the tools, it's you (but we say it nicely... ish)

### Technical Stuff:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks, because irony)
- Custom syntax highlighting with Prism.js
- Brutalist/retro design with orange-brown bear theme
- Bebas Neue + Work Sans font combo
- Smooth scrolling and parallax effects
- Dynamic year display (because maintaining hardcoded dates is for losers)

## 🎯 Why Did You Make This?

Because:
1. Zustand is fucking amazing and more people should use it
2. Redux boilerplate is driving developers insane
3. Context API makes everything re-render like it's 1999
4. The internet needs more aggressive educational content
5. Bears are cool

## 📦 What Do You Get?

A single `justfuckingusezustand.html` file that you can:
- Open directly in any browser
- Host on GitHub Pages
- Deploy to Netlify or whatever you want with zero config
- Email to your Redux-traumatized friends
- Print out and tape to your office wall (we don't judge)

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone this beautiful disaster
git clone https://github.com/Rekl0w/just-fucking-use-zustand.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd just-fucking-use-zustand

# Open the file in your browser
# Windows:
start justfuckingusezustand.html

# macOS:
open justfuckingusezustand.html

# Linux:

Or just download the HTML file and double-click it like it's 2005. We're not your parents.

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to make it even more aggressive? Found a typo? Have better insults? PRs welcome!

Just remember:
- Keep the tone aggressive but not offensive
- Maintain the bear theme (very important)
- Don't add a build process (seriously, don't)
- Test on mobile because people browse on their phones while pretending to work
